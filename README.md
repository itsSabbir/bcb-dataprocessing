# Automated Bioinformatics Pipeline for Human Gene Expression Analysis

This repository provides an end-to-end bioinformatics pipeline that guides users through every stage of human gene expression data analysis. It covers the entire workflow from dataset selection to network visualization and is easily adaptable for both microarray and RNA-seq datasets. By consolidating data cleaning, normalization, differential expression, enrichment analysis, and advanced network visualization into a single system, this pipeline offers a comprehensive resource for researchers seeking a fast and flexible solution.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each module, practical instructions on containerizing the solution with Docker, tips on deploying to Kubernetes, and thorough references. By following these guidelines, any user—regardless of environment—should be able to adapt, extend, and execute the pipeline for their own experimental needs.

## 1. Introduction and Project Rationale

Gene expression studies frequently require multiple analytical steps, each of which can introduce different complexities. This pipeline streamlines those steps to ensure robust data handling and reproducible results. Users can explore any public or private gene expression dataset, clean and normalize it, identify differentially expressed genes, perform enrichment analyses (both thresholded and non-thresholded), and finally map out biological networks for a deeper systems-level understanding of their data.

Example Dataset  
While this pipeline is suitable for most human gene expression studies, it was initially tested on GSE193417, a dataset examining depression-related gene expression in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. The codebase includes references to this dataset as an example. However, users can substitute any other dataset of interest.

## 2. Pipeline Modules and Methodology

### 2.1 Data Acquisition and Selection
- Objective: Obtain a suitable gene expression dataset and confirm the experimental design matches the user’s questions.  
- Recommended Tools:  
  - GEOquery (R package) or direct download from [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).  
  - In-house or custom data may be loaded from delimited text files or databases.  
- Key Considerations:  
  - Sufficient sample size and metadata availability (e.g., condition, treatment).  
  - Modernity of dataset (preferably <10 years old).  
  - Compatibility with chosen bioinformatics tools (array platforms vs. RNA-seq counts).

### 2.2 Data Cleaning and Mapping to HUGO Symbols
- Objective: Convert gene identifiers to a consistent nomenclature (HUGO) while removing problematic entries.  
- Process:  
  1. Load Raw Data: Ensure each sample has associated metadata.  
  2. Quality Control: Generate boxplots/density plots to detect outlier samples.  
  3. Gene Mapping: Use annotation packages such as org.Hs.eg.db or consult the [HGNC](https://www.genenames.org/) database for authoritative gene symbols.  
  4. Deduplication: Merge duplicated genes by retaining the probe with the highest mean expression or using an aggregate method.  
- Key Tools: `tidyverse`, `AnnotationDbi`, `org.Hs.eg.db`.

### 2.3 Normalization
- Objective: Minimize technical variation and batch effects, ensuring samples are comparable.  
- Common Methods:  
  - Quantile Normalization or Robust Multiarray Averaging (RMA) for microarrays ([Bolstad et al., 2003](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12538238/)).  
  - Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) or DESeq2’s method for RNA-seq ([Bioconductor RNA-seq workflows](https://bioconductor.org/help/workflows/rnaseqGene/)).  
- Validation:  
  - Re-plot distributions (boxplots, density plots) post-normalization to confirm uniform sample distributions.

### 2.4 Differential Expression Analysis
- Objective: Identify statistically significant changes in gene expression across conditions (e.g., diseased vs. control).  
- Procedure:  
  1. Model Setup: Define contrasts that correspond to the biological question (e.g., depressed vs. non-depressed).  
  2. Linear or Count-Based Modeling:  
     - limma for microarray data ([Ritchie et al., 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25605792/)).  
     - edgeR or DESeq2 for RNA-seq data.  
  3. Statistical Correction: Use the Benjamini-Hochberg method to adjust p-values and control for false discovery rate (FDR).  
  4. Ranking: Sort genes by adjusted p-value, fold change, or a combined metric.

### 2.5 Thresholded Over-Representation Analysis (ORA)
- Objective: Pinpoint enriched biological processes or pathways from a subset of significantly altered genes (e.g., adjusted p < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1).  
- Key Steps:  
  1. Create DEG Lists: Separate genes into upregulated and downregulated sets.  
  2. Statistical Enrichment: Apply hypergeometric or Fisher’s exact test to determine over-representation in GO terms, KEGG pathways, etc.  
  3. Visualization: Plot top enriched categories via bar or dot plots.  
- Tools: `clusterProfiler`, `enrichR`, [g:Profiler](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/).

### 2.6 Non-Thresholded Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)
- Objective: Extract pathway-level signals across a ranked list of all genes, avoiding arbitrary cutoffs.  
- Steps:  
  1. Full Gene Ranking: Order genes by a metric (e.g., log2 fold change, t-statistic).  
  2. GSEA Algorithm: Evaluate cumulative distribution differences between genes in a pathway versus those not in the pathway ([Reimand et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30610321/)).  
  3. Leading-Edge Analysis: Identify the core subset of genes driving significant enrichment.  
- Tools: `clusterProfiler::GSEA`, `fgsea`.

### 2.7 Network and Pathway Visualization
- Objective: Generate network maps that illustrate how enriched pathways or interacting genes connect and cluster.  
- Implementation:  
  1. Data Preparation: Export gene sets, p-values, and enrichment results.  
  2. Network Creation: Use tools such as Cytoscape or command-line scripts with RCy3 to load interactions.  
  3. EnrichmentMap Plugin: Cluster and annotate pathways with high gene overlap, highlighting central nodes or functional modules ([Saito et al., 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23132118/)).  
- Outcome: An interactive map that helps interpret the biological themes behind differentially expressed genes.

## 3. Containerization with Docker

Objective: Provide a portable, reproducible environment that encapsulates all R packages, libraries, and dependencies.

1. Create a Dockerfile  
   - Base image: `rocker/r-base` or a similar distribution containing R.  
   - Install system dependencies (e.g., libxml2-dev, libssl-dev).  
   - Install R packages (e.g., limma, DESeq2, clusterProfiler, tidyverse).  
2. Build and Tag  
   ```bash
   docker build -t geneexpression_pipeline:latest .
   ```
3. Run Container  
   ```bash
   docker run -it -v $(pwd):/work geneexpression_pipeline:latest R
   ```
   - `-v $(pwd):/work` mounts the current directory into the container for data sharing.

1. Push Docker Image  
   - Host on Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, or a private registry.  
   ```bash
   docker tag geneexpression_pipeline:latest <registry_url>/<namespace>/geneexpression_pipeline:latest
   docker push <registry_url>/<namespace>/geneexpression_pipeline:latest
   ```
2. Create Kubernetes Manifests  
   - Deployment YAML:
     ```yaml

               command: ["Rscript", "/work/Pipeline.R"]  # Example script execution
               volumeMounts:
                 - name: data-volume
                   mountPath: /work/data
           volumes:
             - name: data-volume
               persistentVolumeClaim:
                 claimName: geneexpression-pvc
     ```
3. kubectl Apply  
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f geneexpression_pipeline_deployment.yaml
   ```
4. Data Handling  
   - Attach a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) to store input data and retrieve output results.  
   - Configure environment variables or secrets for specifying dataset URLs, user credentials, etc.
